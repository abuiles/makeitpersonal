Hey <%= @user.username %>

I'm Federico, the guy behind http://makeitpersonal.co. I wanted to welcome you to what I hope will be a growing community in the future. You've probably read the manifesto on our page (http://makeitpersonal.co/manifesto) but if you have any questions or suggestions about the service I'd love to hear back from you. Feel free to reply to this email, email me at federico@mheroin.com or send me a tweet to @febuiles.

By now you will probably want to start annotating a song so go to http://makeitpersonal.co/songs/new and have at it. If you're unsure of how it works just follow the tips on the right column. Again, if there's something that's not clear please let me know and I'll try to help you through it.

If you find this website useful please share it with your friends, I want to stalk them like I will be stalking you :)

Thanks!
